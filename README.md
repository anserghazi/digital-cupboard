## Motivation

Do you enjoy trying your hand at recipes from YouTube cooking channels? Are you frustrated with videos that don't include a link to the recipe/ingredients in the description? Are you tired of scrubbing through videos and jotting down ingredients and heading all the way down to the grocery store, just to find out half your items aren't even in stock?? <sup>I just wanted to make a sandwich..</sup> Well, scrub no further!

## What it is

[Digital Cupboard](https://digitalcupboard.ca/) takes every ingredient mentioned in a YouTube video (using the autogenerated captions) and adds those ingredients to the online shopping cart of your convenience. All you have to do is provide the YouTube URL, review the generated cart, and submit your order through your local grocery store's app/website.
