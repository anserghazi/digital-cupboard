If you enjoy watching cooking videos on YouTube, you've probably encountered a video without an ingredient list or recipe in the description/comments. I'd want to try making some of the meals in these videos, but I shouldn't have to rewatch the entire thing to jot the ingredients down! I want my ingredients *now*. :triumph:

[Digital Cupboard](https://digitalcupboard.ca/) takes every ingredient mentioned in a YouTube video (using the autogenerated captions) and adds those ingredients to the online shopping cart of your convenience. It's easy - enter the URL of the cooking video, review your cart, and submit your order through your local grocery store's app/website.
